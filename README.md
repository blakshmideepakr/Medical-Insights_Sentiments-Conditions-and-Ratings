The safety of a medical product is evaluated through predefined protocols and clinical trials. These clinical studies are carried out under regulated conditions on a limited number of aspects and within a specified time constraint. They may be unable to model real-life scenarios and the associated potential risks. A preeminent solution to this conundrum can be achieved by looking at postmarketing drug surveillance methods such as drug review analysis to monitor drug-related issues. Users often look for stories from "patients like them" on the Internet, which is hard to find among their friends and family. Text mining on drug reviews will be helpful not only for patients to decide which drug to take but also helpful for pharmacy companies and clinicians to improve consumer safety by reducing medication errors and obtaining a valuable summary of the public feedback.

So, In this data science project, I chose to work on analyzing reviews of various drugs, which have been reviewed in the form of texts and given a rating on a scale from 1-10. We obtained this data set from the UCI machine learning repository, which had 2 data sets: train and test (split as 75-25%). The main aim is to examine the use of sentiment analysis on drug reviews that can aid in identifying new opportunities and challenges for any pharmaceutical business. The project aims at classifying the various reviews on the specified drugs based on their polarity with the aid of their rating.
